This white fish, prized for its tender, flaky texture, absorbs marinades beautifully, making it ideal for grilling on a BBQ or gas grill.

Pair it with a side of couscous or a fresh slaw for a balanced meal that’s both satisfying and healthy. Whether you're preparing a simple family dinner or an elegant outdoor gathering, grilled sea bass is sure to impress with its delicate flavour and melt-in-your-mouth texture.
